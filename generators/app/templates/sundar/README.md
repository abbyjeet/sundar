# Sundar UI Kit
Sundar UI Kit is an opinionated UI kit, based on most of the components from Fomantic UI (which is a fork of Semantic UI)

Currently it's just a simple structure of folders with CSS, which you can use to override the core CSS theme.

To use the jquery components/plugins in the scripts folder, 
please add the latest, minified jQuery from CDNs (like jsdelivr) to the index.html in the public folder.

Then you can include the script file for the plugin that you would like to use.

For example: 
```html
<head>
    ...
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    ...
</head>
```
